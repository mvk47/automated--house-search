This application can be used for extracting property details from a website(I have used zillow) and store it into a spreadsheet. The steps needed to do that are:

1. Create a google doc with 3 questions

a. What is the address?

b. What is the price?

c. What is the link to the listing?

2.Then change the chrome driver link in the code and update the google doc link.

3.Run the code.
